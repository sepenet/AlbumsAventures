# Squad Roster Conventions

These conventions define the squad roster: the durable list of roles the Squad Coordinator can dispatch and the HVE Core agent that fills each role. The coordinator reads the roster at the start of every turn to decide who is available, how to invoke them, and which model tier to prefer.

The roster is data, not behavior. It records identities and invocation details. Routing logic lives in `squad-routing.instructions.md`, and persistence rules live in `squad-state.instructions.md`.

## Roster File

The roster lives at `.copilot-tracking/squad/team.md`. The coordinator creates it on first use from the cast catalog below and updates it only through the Squad Scribe.

The file begins with YAML frontmatter and a single H1 title, then a `## Members` table. Each row binds a squad role to a concrete agent.

### Members Schema

The `## Members` table uses these columns:

| Column               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role                 | The squad role name (for example, `lead`, `developer`, `tester`); roles may appear on more than one row when distinguished by `Member Name`                         |
| Member Name          | Optional display name for an individual squad member; required only when two rows share the same `Role` (see *Naming Conventions* below)                            |
| Agent Name (Primary) | The exact `name:` frontmatter value of the deployed HVE Core agent the role resolves to by default                                                                  |
| Alternate Agents     | Optional comma-separated `name:` values the role may resolve to instead, chosen per the catalog cue                                                                 |
| Invocation           | How the coordinator dispatches the agent: `runSubagent`/`task` for non-user-facing roles                                                                            |
| Model Tier           | Preferred cost tier: `fast` for read-heavy roles, `default` for reasoning-heavy roles                                                                               |

Model Tier records a preference, not what actually ran: the concrete model used for each dispatch is captured in the per-dispatch consumption block in `history/<agent>.md` and aggregated into `consumption.md`, never in `team.md`.

The `Agent Name (Primary)` column holds exactly one agent; the role always has a deterministic default. `Alternate Agents` is optional and may be empty for one-to-one roles. The uniqueness key for a row is the (`Role`, `Member Name`) pair, so two rows with the same `Role` are legal when their `Member Name` values differ. When `Member Name` is empty, only one row per `Role` is allowed and the coordinator dispatches that row whenever the role matches. The coordinator resolves the role to a single concrete agent at dispatch time using the *Resolving a Role to an Agent* rules below.

```

### Naming Conventions

The `Member Name` column gives each member a human-readable handle that survives across turns. Names are optional. When a row's `Member Name` is empty, the role is dispatched by role alone (the existing single-row-per-role behavior). When two or more rows share the same `Role`, every such row needs a unique `Member Name` so the coordinator can disambiguate at dispatch time via the user-supplied `owner=<Member Name>` hint.

The coordinator picks a name through one of four paths during Init Mode (see the Squad Coordinator's *Init Mode* propose phase):

1. The user supplies a name per member.
2. The coordinator assigns a deterministic alias from the wordlist below.
3. A mix of (1) and (2): the user names selected members; the coordinator fills the rest.
4. The user skips naming: every `Member Name` stays empty and the role-only behavior holds.

#### Deterministic Alias Wordlist

The coordinator picks aliases in order from this list, skipping any name already in use within the seeded roster. The list is intentionally small, ASCII-safe, and stable across runs so two squads seeded with the same profile receive the same default names.

```text
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi, Omega
```

When the seeded roster needs more than 24 names, the coordinator restarts the list and appends `-2`, `-3`, and so on (`Alpha-2`, `Beta-2`).

## Cast Catalog

The cast catalog is the default casting source and the canonical mapping between squad roles (members) and deployed HVE Core agents, keyed by each agent's exact `name:` frontmatter value. When a project has no `team.md`, the coordinator seeds the roster from this catalog.

The relationship between roles and agents is **many-to-many**. A role names one **Primary** agent — the default the coordinator dispatches — plus optional **Alternate** agents it may resolve to instead when the request matches a **Selection Cue**. A single agent may also fill more than one role (for example, `Codebase Profiler` serves both `researcher` and `security`). See *Relationship Cardinality* below.

Roles that have no stable HVE Core equivalent are marked **thin charter needed**. A thin charter is a small, squad-owned subagent authored under `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/` when the role is actually required; until then the coordinator omits the role or escalates to the user.

| Role             | Primary Agent (`name:`)       | Alternate Agents (`name:`)                                                                                          | Selection Cue                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Relationship Cardinality

The mapping deliberately supports three shapes so squad roles can stay human-meaningful while reusing the full HVE Core cast:

* **One-to-one** — a role maps to a single agent with no alternates. Examples: `rai → RAI Planner`, `challenger → Task Challenger`, `experimenter → Experiment Designer`.
* **One-to-many** — a role maps to a Primary plus Alternates, and the coordinator resolves to one agent per the Selection Cue. Examples: `product-owner` resolves across the ADO/GitHub/Jira backlog managers by tracker; `tester` resolves across the review and validator agents by review sub-type.
* **Many-to-one** — a single agent fills more than one role. Examples: `Codebase Profiler` serves `researcher` and `security`; `Finding Deep Verifier` serves `fact-checker`, `tester`, and `security`; `Product Manager Advisor` serves `product-owner` and `analyst`; `Phase Implementor` serves `lead` and `developer`; `Plan Validator` serves `lead` and `tester`; `Meeting Analyst` serves `researcher` and `analyst`.

A shared agent is not a conflict: each role dispatches it with role-scoped context, and the Squad Scribe records which role invoked it under that role's history.

## Resolving a Role to an Agent

The coordinator turns a matched role into exactly one concrete agent at dispatch time:

1. **Default to the Primary agent** named in the role's `team.md` row (seeded from this catalog).
2. **Apply the Selection Cue** — when the request matches a cue, dispatch the indicated Alternate instead of the Primary.
3. **Verify the agent is installed.** The resolved agent must be present in the project (its APM package deployed into `.github/`). When it is absent, escalate to the user — treat it the same as a **thin charter needed** role rather than silently substituting.
4. **Record any non-primary resolution** through the Squad Scribe, so `history/<agent>.md` reflects the agent that actually ran and the cue that selected it.
5. **Never self-fill an absent role.** When the resolved agent is not installed or not available, the coordinator stops and escalates to the user. It must not perform the role's work itself, and must not substitute a non-mapped agent to fill the gap. An absent role blocks the stage until the user installs the agent, names a substitute, or removes the role.

## Casting Rules

* Use the exact `name:` frontmatter value from the deployed agent. Names with spaces are quoted when referenced from prompt or agent frontmatter.
* Prefer a deployed HVE Core agent (Primary or Alternate) over a new charter. Author a thin charter only when a required role has no reasonable HVE Core fit.
* Keep exactly one Primary per role so dispatch is always deterministic; list every other valid agent under Alternate Agents with a Selection Cue.
* Treat `fact-checker → Finding Deep Verifier` as a best-fit mapping: the agent verifies findings rather than performing general fact-checking, so confirm it suits the request before dispatch.
* Record any deviation from the catalog (a substituted agent, a non-primary resolution, or a new charter) through the Squad Scribe so the roster stays the single source of truth.

## Squad Profiles

A squad profile is a named, project-tailored subset of the cast catalog. Profiles let a project choose the squad that fits its work instead of always seeding the full cast. The coordinator selects a profile during Init Mode (see the Squad Coordinator agent), and the Squad Scribe stamps the chosen profile's members into `team.md`.

The `scribe` role is always included in every profile — it is the single writer of squad state and is never proposed as an optional member.

Every profile also carries the **methodology spine**: `researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, and `tester` — the four roles that run the HVE Core delivery cycle of Research → Plan → Implement → Review. The spine guarantees that, whatever a project's specialization, the squad can always research a question, plan the work, implement the change, and review the result; each profile adds its specialist roles on top. A user may drop a spine role during Init Mode, but that disables the matching leg of the methodology and the Implementation Gate in `squad-routing.instructions.md` escalates if the removed role is later needed.

Some profiles also carry **deliverable-producing roles** — roles whose output is a standalone, user-facing artifact (a requirements document, a refined backlog, a design study, an experiment design, a slide deck, written documentation, or a data notebook) rather than a code or infrastructure change owned by `developer`. These roles are `analyst`, `product-owner`, `designer`, `experimenter`, `presenter`, `technical-writer`, and `data-scientist`. When a profile carries two or more of them — the `product` profile is the canonical case — the work is a set of distinct deliverables rather than a single build, and autopilot fans its Implement stage out across the owning specialists instead of dispatching a single `developer` (see *Deliverable Fan-Out* in `squad-autopilot.instructions.md`). Every other profile carries at most one deliverable-producing role, so its Implement stage stays the unchanged single build.

| Profile        | Members (roles)                                                                                                                                | Choose when the project is…                                              |

| `design`       | researcher, lead, developer, tester, designer, scribe                                                                                          | UX/UI, accessibility, or product-design focused                          |
| `architecture` | researcher, lead, developer, tester, architect, azure-architect, cost-manager, scribe                                                          | System design, infrastructure, or architecture-review focused            |

| `product`      | researcher, lead, developer, tester, analyst, designer, product-owner, presenter, technical-writer, experimenter, scribe                       | Business discovery and delivery — requirements, design thinking, roadmap, and stakeholder deliverables (often non-technical) |

### Profile Selection

The coordinator chooses a profile in this order of precedence:

1. **Explicit choice** — the user names a profile (for example, `profile=security`) or confirms one during Init Mode.
2. **Project discovery** — the coordinator infers a profile from repository signals when the user does not name one:
   * Source files, tests, and package manifests with no specialized signal → `default`.
   * Authentication, secrets, threat modeling, ML/LLM, or data-handling signals → `security`.
   * Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular), CSS, or accessibility signals → `design`.
   * Bicep templates plus budget, pricing, FinOps, or `cost-manager` signals (or `.bicep` files alongside an Azure landing-zone reference) → `azure`.
   * Infrastructure-as-code (Bicep, Terraform without Azure-specific cost signals), system-design docs, or component diagrams → `architecture`.
   * Requirements documents (BRD/PRD), product or roadmap docs, discovery/design-thinking artifacts, or a repository with little or no source code where the work is business discovery and delivery → `product`.
   * Mixed or unclear signals → propose `default` and offer `full`.
3. **Fallback** — when discovery is inconclusive and the user gives no hint, propose `default` as the recommended profile.

A profile only ever lists roles that exist in the cast catalog. Roles marked **thin charter needed** (such as `devrel`) are never part of a profile until a charter is authored.

### Building a Custom Roster

When no named profile fits — or when one is close but not exact — the coordinator helps the user assemble a custom roster rather than inventing one. The coordinator presents the role menu below — each row is a role the squad can dispatch, the plain-language work it contributes, and the deployed agent that fills it by default — and the user picks any subset. The user may start from a profile's roles and add or remove from there; when they do, the roster is recorded as a custom roster derived from that profile, because any change to a profile's exact member set makes it custom.

Three rules bound a custom roster so it never references work the squad cannot actually do:

* **`scribe` is always included** — it is the single writer of squad state and is never offered as optional.
* **The methodology spine (`researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, `tester`) is recommended** so the Research → Plan → Implement → Review cycle stays intact. The user may drop a spine role, but that disables the matching leg and the Implementation Gate in `squad-routing.instructions.md` escalates if it is later needed.
* **Only catalog roles are selectable.** The coordinator never invents a role or an agent outside the cast catalog. A role whose mapped agent is not installed, or a **thin charter needed** role such as `devrel`, is flagged and left out rather than seeded.

The menu mirrors the Cast Catalog above; each item names the role, the deployed agent that fills it by default (in parentheses), and the user-facing gloss.

* **researcher** (Task Researcher) — Investigates the codebase, the web, and connected tools to gather the context the squad needs.
* **lead** (Task Planner) — Plans the work: breaks a request into tasks, sequences them, and can run the full delivery cycle.
* **developer** (Task Implementor) — Implements the change: writes and edits code to carry out the plan.
* **tester** (Task Reviewer) — Reviews changes for quality, correctness, and standards before they ship.
* **challenger** (Task Challenger) — Pressure-tests a plan or its assumptions as a devil's advocate before the squad commits.
* **architect** (System Architecture Reviewer) — Reviews system-design tradeoffs and well-architected alignment; can produce ADRs and diagrams.
* **security** (Security Planner) — Plans security: threat-models the work, identifies risks, and maps controls.
* **rai** (RAI Planner) — Assesses responsible-AI concerns such as fairness, harm, and transparency for AI/ML work.
* **fact-checker** (Finding Deep Verifier) — Independently verifies findings and claims before the squad trusts them.
* **designer** (UX UI Designer) — Researches users and designs the experience: journey maps, jobs-to-be-done, and accessibility.
* **product-owner** (ADO Backlog Manager) — Manages the backlog: triages, refines, and organizes work items in your tracker.
* **analyst** (PRD Builder) — Captures product and business requirements as a PRD or BRD.
* **data-scientist** (DS Gen Data Spec) — Profiles data and builds exploratory-analysis notebooks and dashboards.
* **prompt-engineer** (Prompt Builder) — Authors and refines prompts, agents, instructions, and skills.
* **technical-writer** (Doc Ops) — Authors and maintains documentation that stays in step with the code.
* **presenter** (PowerPoint Builder) — Builds slide decks and executive summaries.

* **azure-architect** (Squad Azure Architect) — Authors Azure high- and low-level designs with AVM modules and landing-zone patterns.
* **iac-author** (Squad IaC Author) — Converts an Azure design into Bicep or Terraform; authors IaC but never deploys.
* **deployer** (Squad Deployer) — Runs Azure deployments behind a human approval gate; defaults to a read-only dry run.
* **modernizer** (Squad Modernization Planner) — Plans framework, dependency, and cloud-migration modernization.
* **asbuilt-author** (Squad As-Built Author) — Documents already-deployed infrastructure (inventory, compliance, runbook, DR); strictly read-only.
* **azure-diagnose** (Squad Azure Diagnose) — Triages deployed Azure resources read-only into ranked hypotheses; recommends but never applies fixes.
* **scribe** (Squad Scribe) — Writes squad state: decisions, history, and memory. Always included; never optional.
